      description: |
        Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.
        
        If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the code. It is very important for the snippet to be as succinct (minimal) as possible, so please take time to trim down any irrelevant code to help us debug efficiently. We are going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same result as you did: avoid any external data, and include the relevant imports, etc. For example:

        ```python
        from dbm_lib.config import config_reader, config_raw_feature, config_derive_feature
        from dbm_lib.controller import process_feature as pf
        from dbm_lib.dbm_features.raw_features.video import open_face_process as of
        from dbm_lib.dbm_features.derived_features import derive as der

        import pandas as pd
        import os
        import argparse
        import logging
        import glob
        import time
        import subprocess
        from os.path import splitext

        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
        logger=logging.getLogger()

        OPENFACE_PATH_VIDEO = 'pkg/open_dbm/OpenFace/build/bin/FaceLandmarkVid'
        OPENFACE_PATH = 'pkg/open_dbm/OpenFace/build/bin/FeatureExtraction'
        DEEP_SPEECH = 'pkg/DeepSpeech'
        DLIB_SHAPE_MODEL = 'pkg/shape_detector/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat'
        ```

        If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com.

        In short, **we are going to copy-paste your code** to run it and we expect to get the same result as you.

        We acknowledge that crafting a minimal reproducible code example requires some effort on your side but it really helps the maintainers quickly reproduce the problem and analyze its cause without any ambiguity. Ambiguous bug reports tend to be slower to fix because they will require more effort and back and forth discussion between the maintainers and the reporter to pin-point the precise conditions necessary to reproduce the problem.
