# The OpenDBM Community

There are some developers / researchers around the world using OpenDBM. This is a brief overview of where you can find them.

## Where To Get Help

If you need help with your OpenDBM library, the right place to go depends on the type of help that you need.

### Repository

The core of **OpenDBM** is worked on full-time by AiCure's OpenDBM team. But there are far more people in the community who make key contributions and fix things. If the issue you are facing is code related, you should consider checking the open issues in the [main repository](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/issues). If you cannot find an existing issue, please [use the Bug Report template](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.yaml) to create an issue with a minimal example.

### Stack Overflow

Many members of the community use Stack Overflow to ask questions. Read through the [existing questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/opendbm?sort=frequent) tagged with **opendbm** or [ask your own](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=opendbm)!

## Staying up to date
### Discussion

OpenDBM is still a young library, and its rapid release cycle leaves the door open for discussing how it can evolve at every step of the way. If you want to know the discussions that are talking about, you can read through the [Discussions](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/discussions).

### Conferences

You can check the [OpenDBM Meetups](https://aicure.com/opendbm/) that happen around the world. 

## Communities

### Forum-like groups

We want to ensure that OpenDBM feels like a community of like-minded researchers and clinicians. Hence, there are a few ways we encourage users to stay involved––and why we encourage you [to join DiME, too!](https://www.dimesociety.org/)
