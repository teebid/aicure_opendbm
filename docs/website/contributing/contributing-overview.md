Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenDBM! From commenting on and triaging issues, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests, all contributions are welcome.
We aim to build a vibrant and inclusive [ecosystem of partners, core contributors, and community](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/blob/main/ECOSYSTEM.md) that goes beyond the main OpenDBM GitHub repository.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.

Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

We want to ensure that OpenDBM feels like a community of like-minded researchers and clinicians. Hence, there are a few ways we encourage users to stay involved––and why we [encourage you to join DiME, too!](https://www.dimesociety.org/)
