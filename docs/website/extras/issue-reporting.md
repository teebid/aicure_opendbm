For any technical issues with using the code i.e. during installation and during use, we ask that you––instead of emailing us––bring up the issue using the Issues feature on Github i.e. in the [Issues](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/issues) tab on the OpenDBM github, We have written out an [Issue template](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) that will automatically populate when you create a new issue; we suggest you follow that template.
