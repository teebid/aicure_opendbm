Welcome to the Resources section! If you're getting started with OpenDBM, please refer to <a href="/docs/getting-started">Guides</a> section. Continue reading to learn about OpenDBM surrounding components! In this section, we’ve put together some resources that don’t quite fit in any of the other chapters of this documentation but are helpful things to know regardless.
:::

This section is intended to share the surrounding components inside OpenDBM repository. The intended components includes CI/CD pipeline, REST API for demo purpose and how this documentation built. It is not a requirement to be familiar with this material to be effective with OpenDBM. You can still benefit from this section as it will give you insights into how we manage things to give added values to this repository. Feel free to share your feedback on the [discussion group](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/discussions/categories/general) for this section.
