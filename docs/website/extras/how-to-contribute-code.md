title: Contribute Guidelines
---

With OpenDBM v2.0, we’ve also written out a simple version of [contribution guidelines,](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) available with the code base. We want to make these more detailed in the future. As we work with the first independent contributors to OpenDBM, we will be coming out with a much more robust packet of instructions for contributors. If you find the current guidelines confusing or have trouble contributing to OpenDBM, please definitely [reach out to us](mailto:opendbm@aicure.com) and we’re happy to assist.
