[Use this link to sign up for the OpenDBM Listserv and stay up to date on release and events.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLrgyM08YIumzJw8dxmRaMQ4byBL3J4A90FpokDhX8-KUNZw/viewform)

From time to time, we will be making either small updates to OpenDBM functionalities (additional variables, bug fixes, etc.) or large version releases with major additions to features (e.g., we want a future update to OpenDBM to include analysis of wearable data). We will also be hosting virtual (and hopefully one day in-person) events for the OpenDBM user community that allow for training, introduction to new functionalities, presentations on prominent projects, etc. In either of these cases, we’d like to keep the user community up to date so that they don’t miss out on these updates or events, so we do encourage you to [sign up for the listserv.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLrgyM08YIumzJw8dxmRaMQ4byBL3J4A90FpokDhX8-KUNZw/viewform)
