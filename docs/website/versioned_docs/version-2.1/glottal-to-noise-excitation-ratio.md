title: Glottal-to-noise Excitation Ratio (GNE)
---

Glottal-to-noise excitation ratio, as introduced by Michaelis and colleagues[^1], is an indirect measure of breathiness, indicating whether a “given voice signal originates from vibrations in the vocal folds or from turbulent noise generated in the vocal tract.”
