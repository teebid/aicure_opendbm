title: Facial Tremor
---

Measurements of facial tremor are acquired by looking at movements in individual facial landmarks as shown in Section 5.1.1. They are separated into measurements of tremor at individual landmarks of the face, which allows for specific calculation of tremor in particular areas of the face but can also be averaged to measure tremor in larger areas of the face or the entire face as a whole.
