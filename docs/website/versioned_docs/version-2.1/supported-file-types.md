title: Supported File Types
---

First and foremost––OpenDBM only supports MP4 and MOV for video files and MP3 and WAV for audio files. Though there are several freely available online tools to convert file types quickly and easily, we advise that you be careful when using them given they do not guarantee data privacy and security. Instead, there are python packages available for local file conversion. Future versions of OpenDBM may support additional file types. For now, the user is responsible for doing this.
