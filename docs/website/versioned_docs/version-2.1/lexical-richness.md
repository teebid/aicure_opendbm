title: Lexical Richness
---

There are several terms for this measurement used across literature (sometimes also called diversity in vocabulary, etc.) and certainly more than one way to quantify it. We felt that an appropriate measure of richness of vocabulary would be the Moving Average Type Token Ratio (MATTR), reported in this paper by Convington and McFall[^1]. Simply put, it quantifies how many unique words are used in speech, which can be a proxy to some clinical measurements.
